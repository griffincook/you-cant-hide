# you-cant-hide
A 3D Unity Horror Game inspired by Slenderman. <br>
The player must run around in the woods collecting red cubes and fighting off evil mushrooms. Every once and a while a larger monster will find the player and they must run for their life. Collect all 10 cubes and take them to the one friendly mushroom at the mountain to move on to the boss battle. In the boss battle, the player must collect shots by attacking the mushrooms and shoot them at the monster, which is now the size of a skyscraper.
